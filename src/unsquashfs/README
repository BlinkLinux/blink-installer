Extract squash filesystem. Works with low memory machine.

Basic process:
* First mount squashfs to system
* Then copy each file in that folder to target, including file permissions.

If extraction progress is required, use `--progress` option.

Known issues:
* Selected squashfs file can be mounted to one mount-point each time.
  Or else `mount` command raise device-busy error.
